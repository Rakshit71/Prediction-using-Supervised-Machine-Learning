# Checking the heat map which also shows that the relation between hous and scores is very strong.
# We have to predict the score if a person studies for 9.25 hours so making a data test data frame for it.
p<-as.data.frame(9.25)

# Doing Linear regression for the training data.
LinearModel<-lm(Scores~Hours, data = Intern_Sparks_Data)
summary(LinearModel)
# So, now it becomes prominent that Hours shows a significant impact on Scores. Based on the p value, which is less than .05.
# Our model is-
# Scores = 2.4837 + 9.7758*Hours
# Means a change of 1 unit in hours will change the scores by 9.7758.
# Predicting the scores if someone will study for 9.25 hours.
predict(LinearModel, newdata = p)
# So, Our model has predicted that if someone will study for 9.25hours so the score will be approx 93.
# Thank You.
